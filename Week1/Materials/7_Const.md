Below is a GERNERALIZED list of rules when it comes to `const`. From this point on in your labs you should be thinking about what needs to be const and why -- this rule set is here to help. For the most part in the first 2 weeks you will be adding `const` where needed in the parameters of your methods as a hint.

## **Basic Rules of `const` in C++**

### 1. **Constant Variables**
A `const` variable is a variable that cannot be modified. Its value cannot change, and it is what we call in programming **immutable**. If you see the word immutable, we are usually referring to something being protected from change using the `const` keyword.

Example:
```cpp
const int x = 5;
```
In this example, `x` cannot be modified after it is initialized. `x` must be initialized at the time of declaration due to it being `const`.

---

### 2. **Function Parameters (Const References)**
A `const &` (const reference) parameter means that the function receives a reference to the original data without copying it, and promises not to modify it. This technique reduces memory usage and improves performance while also ensuring data safety.

Example:
```cpp
void print(const std::string& s);
```
In this example, we have a function declaration named `print` that takes in a `const &` of a `std::string`. This `string` is passed by reference (so it avoids copying), and marked as `const` because the function doesn’t need to change it.

---

### 3. **Const Member Functions**
A `const` member function is a function that does not modify the internal state of the object. It is indicated by placing the `const` keyword after the function signature. Only `const` member functions can be called on `const` objects.

Example:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    int getValue() const; //cannot modify the "price" field of the class.
private:
    double price;
};
```
In this example, `getValue` is a const member function, which means it cannot modify any member variables of the object (unless they are marked `mutable`).

---

### 4. **Const Objects**
A `const` object is one declared with the `const` keyword, meaning it cannot be modified after creation. Only `const` member functions can be called on such objects.

Example:
```cpp
const MyClass obj;
```
In this example, we have declared a `const` object of type `MyClass`. This means that `obj` cannot be modified, and only member functions marked as `const` can be called on it (like `getValue()` in the previous example).

---

### 5. **Const in Function Return Types**

Returning `const` by **value** is rarely useful and often avoided, because the returned copy is still modifiable by the caller.

Example:
```cpp
const int getVal();  // Usually discouraged
```
Returning `const` by **reference** is more useful. It avoids copying large objects and ensures the returned reference cannot be used to modify the original data.

Example:
```cpp
const std::string& getName() const;
```
In this example, the function returns a `const` reference to a string, meaning the caller can access the string but not change it.
