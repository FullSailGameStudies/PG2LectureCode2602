## 🧠 What is Upcasting?

**Upcasting** is the process of converting a pointer or reference of a **derived class** to a **base class** type. It is called "upcasting" because in a class hierarchy, the base class is conceptually higher than the derived class.

```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() {
        std::cout << "Animal speaks\n";
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override {
        std::cout << "Dog barks\n";
    }
};

Animal myPet = Dog();  // only copies the Animal parts of Dog to the myPet variable
Animal* aPtr = new Dog(); // 🔼 Upcasting. points aPtr to the Dog object
aPtr->speak(); // Output: Dog barks (due to polymorphism)
delete aPtr; // deallocate the Dog object
```

## ✅ Key Characteristics

- **Safe and implicit**: No cast operator is needed.
- **Supports polymorphism**: If the base class has virtual functions, the derived class's overridden methods will be called.
- **Loses access to derived-specific members**: Only base class members are accessible through the base class pointer/reference.

## 🧪 Why Use Upcasting?

### 🔄 Polymorphism
Allows writing flexible and reusable code that works with base class types but behaves according to the derived class implementation.

```cpp
void makeItSpeak(Animal* a) {
    a->speak(); // Calls the appropriate speak() method
}
```

### 🧰 Code Reusability
You can store different derived objects in a single container of base class pointers:

```cpp
std::vector<Animal*> zoo;
zoo.push_back(new Dog());
zoo.push_back(new Cat());
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- You **cannot access** members that are only in the derived class.
- If you need to access derived-specific functionality, you must **downcast** (with care).

## 🧭 Summary

| Feature              | Upcasting |
|----------------------|-----------|
| Direction            | Derived → Base |
| Safe?                | ✅ Yes |
| Implicit?            | ✅ Yes |
| Polymorphic behavior | ✅ Yes (if virtual functions are used) |
| Access to derived members | ❌ No |
