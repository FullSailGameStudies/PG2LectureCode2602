# 📘 The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming is built on four foundational principles—**Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**. These pillars work together to create modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Below is a detailed discussion of each:

---

### 🤝 Interrelationship of Pillars
- **Encapsulation** and **Abstraction** work together to hide complexity.
- **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism** enable extensibility and dynamic behavior.
- Combined, these pillars make OOP powerful for building modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## 🔒 Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the principle of **bundling data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit**, typically a class, and restricting direct access to some components. This is achieved through **access modifiers** (e.g., `private`, `protected`, `public`).

- **Purpose:**  
  - Protects the internal state of an object from unintended interference.
  - Promotes modularity and maintainability.
- **Example:**  
  A `BankAccount` class hides its balance behind getter and setter methods, ensuring validation before changes.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  Reduces coupling and increases cohesion.

## 🎭 Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on **exposing only essential features while hiding unnecessary details**. It allows developers to work at a higher conceptual level without worrying about implementation complexity.

- **Purpose:**  
  - Simplifies interaction with complex systems.
  - Provides clear contracts through abstract classes or interfaces.
- **Example:**  
  An interface `PaymentProcessor` defines methods like `processPayment()`, without specifying how the payment is processed internally.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  Enhances flexibility and scalability.

## 🌳 Inheritance
Inheritance enables a class (child or subclass) to **reuse and extend the properties and behaviors of another class (parent or superclass)**.

- **Purpose:**  
  - Promotes code reuse.
  - Establishes hierarchical relationships.
- **Example:**  
  A `Car` class inherits from a `Vehicle` class, gaining attributes like `speed` and methods like `move()`.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  Reduces redundancy and supports polymorphism.
- **Caution:**  
  Overuse can lead to fragile hierarchies; composition is often preferred for flexibility.

---

## 🔄 Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows **objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface**, while each object can respond differently to the same method call.

- **Types:**  
  - **Compile-time (Static):** Method overloading.
  - **Run-time (Dynamic):** Method overriding via inheritance.
- **Example:**  
  A `draw()` method behaves differently for `Circle` and `Rectangle` objects, even when called through a `Shape` reference.
- **Key Benefit:**  
  Enables extensibility and dynamic behavior without modifying existing code.
