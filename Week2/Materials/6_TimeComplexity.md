**Time complexity** is a way to describe **how the running time of an algorithm increases** as the size of the input grows.

Think of it as a **mathematical estimate** of how much time your code will take to run, especially when dealing with **large amounts of data**.

## 📦 Why Does It Matter?

Imagine sorting a list of 10 names vs. 10 million names. You want to know:
- Will your algorithm still be fast?
- Will it slow down a little or a lot?

Time complexity helps you **predict performance** without actually running the program.

## ⏱️ Big-O Notation

We use **Big-O notation** to express time complexity. It describes the **upper bound** of an algorithm’s running time.

Here are some common time complexities:

| Big-O Notation | Name              | Example Scenario                     |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| O(1)      | Constant time     | Accessing an array element           |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic time  | Binary search                        |
| O(n)      | Linear time       | Looping through an array             |
| O(n log n) | Log-linear time | Merge sort, Quick sort (average)     |
| O(n^2)    | Quadratic time    | Nested loops (e.g., bubble sort)     |
| O(2^n)    | Exponential time  | Recursive algorithms (e.g., brute force) |

## 🧪 Example: Linear vs. Quadratic

Let’s say you have a list of `n` numbers:

- A **linear algorithm** (like finding the max) checks each number once → \( O(n) \)
- A **quadratic algorithm** (like comparing every pair) does \( n \times n \) comparisons → \( O(n^2) \)

So if `n = 1,000`:
- Linear: ~1,000 steps
- Quadratic: ~1,000,000 steps 😬

## 🧭 Key Takeaways

- Time complexity helps you **compare algorithms**.
- It focuses on **growth rate**, not exact time.
- **Lower time complexity = better scalability**.
