## 🧠 What is Recursion?

**Recursion** is a programming technique where **a function calls itself** to solve a problem. Each recursive call should bring the problem closer to a **base case** (also known as **exit condition**), which is a condition that stops the recursion.

### Key Components:
1. **Base Case** – The condition under which the function stops calling itself.
2. **Recursive Case** – The part where the function calls itself with a modified argument.

## 🔁 Why Use Recursion?

Recursion is particularly useful for problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems, such as:
- Factorials
- Fibonacci numbers
- Tree traversal
- Backtracking problems (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens)
- Divide and conquer algorithms (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

## 🧪 When to Use Recursion

Use recursion when:
- The problem has a natural recursive structure.
- You can define a clear base case.
- The depth of recursion is manageable.

## 🧮 Example 1: Factorial Function

The factorial of a number \( n \) is defined as:


`n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1`


### C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1; // Base case
    return n * factorial(n - 1); // Recursive case
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    int result = factorial(num);
    cout << "Factorial of " << num << " is " << result << endl;
}
```

### Output:
```
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

## 🧬 Example 2: Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:


`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1`

### C++ Code:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 0; // Base case
    if (n == 1) return 1; // Base case
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // Recursive case
}

int main() {
    int n = 6;
    cout << "Fibonacci number at position " << n << " is " << fibonacci(n) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
Fibonacci number at position 6 is 8
```

## ⚠️ Pitfalls of Recursion

- **Stack Overflow**: Too many recursive calls can exhaust the call stack.
- **Performance**: Naive recursion (like in Fibonacci) can be inefficient due to repeated calculations.

### Optimization Tip:
Use [**memoization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) or [**dynamic programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming) to improve performance.
