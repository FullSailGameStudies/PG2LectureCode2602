## 🧠 1. Conceptual Overview

### **Linear Search (Sequential Search)**

Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm. It checks each element in a list **one by one** until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

- **No assumptions** about the order of elements.
- Works on **unsorted or sorted** data.
- Easy to implement and understand.

```cpp
//-1 means not found because it is an invalid index
const int NOT_FOUND = -1;

int LinearSearch(const std::vector<int>& numbers, int numberToFind)
{
	int index = NOT_FOUND;
	for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
	{
		if (numberToFind == numbers[i])
		{
			index = i;
			break;
		}
	}
	return index;
}

int main() 
{
	std::vector<int> nums = { 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 };
	std::vector<int> searchNumbers = { 0,9,15,5 };
	for (auto& searchNumber : searchNumbers)
	{
		int index = LinearSearch(nums, searchNumber);
		if (index == NOT_FOUND)
			std::cout << searchNumber << " was not found.\n";
		else
			std::cout << searchNumber << " was found at index " << index << ".\n";
	}
}
```

### Output:
```cpp
0 was found at index 0.
9 was found at index 9.
15 was not found.
5 was found at index 5.
```

### **Binary Search**

Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that repeatedly divides a **sorted** list in half to locate a target value.

- Requires the list to be **sorted** in advance.
- Eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step.
- Much faster for large datasets.

#### Binary Search pseudocode
```cpp
// initially called with low = 0, high = N-1
BinarySearch(A[0..N-1], searchTerm, low, high) 
{
      if (high < low)
            return -1 // -1 means not found
      mid = (low + high) / 2
      if (searchTerm < A[mid])
          return BinarySearch(A, searchTerm, low, mid-1)
      else if (searchTerm > A[mid])
          return BinarySearch(A, searchTerm, mid+1, high)
      else
          return mid //the searchTerm was found so return its index
  }
```

## ⏱️ 2. Time Complexity

| Algorithm         | Best Case     | Average Case     | Worst Case     |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Linear Search** | O(1)          |  O(n)            |  O(n)          |
| **Binary Search** | O(1)          |  O(log n)        |  O(log n)      |

- **Linear Search**: Best case is when the target is the first element; worst case is when it's the last or not present.
- **Binary Search**: Best case is when the target is the middle element; otherwise, it logarithmically narrows the search space.

## 🧰 3. Use Cases

### Use **Linear Search** when:
- The dataset is **unsorted**.
- The list is **small**, and performance is not critical.
- You want a **simple and quick** implementation.

### Use **Binary Search** when:
- The dataset is **sorted**.
- You need **fast lookups** in large datasets.
- You can afford the **preprocessing cost** of sorting (if not already sorted).

## 🧪 4. Example Scenario

Imagine searching for a student's ID in a list of 1,000 names:

- If the list is **unsorted**, linear search is your only option.
- If the list is **sorted alphabetically**, binary search can find the ID in about **10 comparisons** (since \( \log_2(1000) \approx 10 \)).

## ✅ 5. Summary Table

| Feature              | Linear Search         | Binary Search         |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Requires Sorted Data | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                 |
| Time Complexity      | O(n)                  |  O(log n)               |
| Implementation       | ✅ Simple             | ⚠️ Slightly complex    |
| Flexibility          | ✅ Any data           | ❌ Sorted only         |
| Performance (Large n)| ❌ Slower             | ✅ Much faster         |
